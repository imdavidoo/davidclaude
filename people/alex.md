# Alex (colleague at PetRadar)

## Profile
- **Role**: Employee at PetRadar
- **Reports to**: David and Tom

## Dynamics with David
- **Working style alignment**: Much more at ease with Tom's relaxed working style than David's driven approach — understandable since it's more pleasant for an employee.
- **Core friction**: Gives significant resistance to David's way of working. Dislikes when David pushes the bar. David feels like his drive annoys her.
- **Strengths**: When given tasks in her skill zone, she pushes really hard and performs well. The issue isn't that she can't push — it's that the range of tasks where she can push effectively is narrower than what the team needs.
- **Limitations**: When given something outside her comfort or skill range, she resists a lot. This creates friction with David who wants to keep raising the bar.
- **David's feeling**: Feels unappreciated — like being a powerhouse is seen as an inconvenience rather than a strength. "I am a powerhouse, and whenever I am being a powerhouse, I feel like they kind of dislike me for that, especially Alex."
