# Tom (friend & co-founder)

## Profile
- **Known for**: ~13 years (since ~2013)
- **Age**: 28 (same as David)
- **Role**: Co-founder of PetRadar
- **Personality**: Calm, rational, stable
- **Girlfriend**: Has health issues (as of Feb 2026), which sometimes explains Tom's withdrawal/unavailability

## Dynamics with David
- **Strengths**: Rationality is genuinely helpful. Models healthy work-life balance — he can let go and stop pushing in ways David can't, and sometimes that's genuinely inspiring
- **Communication**: Not great at communicating when something personal is going on. David initially reads withdrawal as disengagement, but it's usually something behind the scenes. David has to ask directly to find out.
- **Core tension**: David pushes relentlessly and can't let go; Tom is measured and can. This creates two opposite reactions in David:
  - *Positive*: Tom's approach inspires David to ease up, and when David actually lets go too, it often feels surprisingly nice
  - *Frustration*: Feels like a mismatch in commitment. "I'm pushing so hard and you're just... not." David knows intellectually that Tom's stability might actually produce better results, but emotionally it's hard.
- **Boundary set (Feb 2026)**: David told Tom his girlfriend keeps crashing their calls and that's not okay. Accepted Tom's need to be with his girlfriend but drew a line on work calls being interrupted.

## To discuss
- **AI-assisted refactoring workflow**: Use the full context window to ask AI for refactors — it discovers its own pain points naturally (like a human dev would), and can write tests from that same context
- **Career direction: engineering vs business** — David's growing pull toward building technically hard products vs the business-heavy work at PetRadar. Where does Tom stand on this? How does it affect PetRadar's future and what comes after?

## History
- Used to have long nights debating together — those were a lot of fun. The friendship predates the work relationship by many years.
