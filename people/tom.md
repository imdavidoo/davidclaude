# Tom (friend & co-founder)

## Profile
- **Known for**: ~13 years (since ~2013)
- **Age**: 28 (same as David)
- **Role**: Co-founder of PetRadar
- **Personality**: Calm, rational, stable
- **Girlfriend**: Has health issues (as of Feb 2026), which sometimes explains Tom's withdrawal/unavailability

## Dynamics with David
- **Strengths**: Rationality is genuinely helpful. More stable and grounded on strategic decisions. Models healthy work-life balance — he can let go and stop pushing in ways David can't, and sometimes that's genuinely inspiring. David sees him as a "very positive influence on PetRadar" overall.
- **Communication**: Not great at communicating when something personal is going on. David initially reads withdrawal as disengagement, but it's usually something behind the scenes. David has to ask directly to find out.
- **Core tension**: David pushes relentlessly and can't let go; Tom is measured and can. This creates two opposite reactions in David:
  - *Positive*: Tom's approach inspires David to ease up, and when David actually lets go too, it often feels surprisingly nice
  - *Frustration*: Feels like a mismatch in commitment. "I'm pushing so hard and you're just... not." Tom doesn't push unless needed. David knows intellectually that Tom's stability might actually produce better results, but emotionally it's hard.
  - *Working style metaphor*: Tom is "the stable engine" — does something every day at a measured pace. David is "the lion" — sprints hard then recovers. Both approaches have value; David increasingly recognizes they should be utilized for their respective strengths rather than forced into one mode.
  - *Autonomy friction*: Having a true equal means needing to agree on things, feeling like he "owes" Tom, and not being able to just decide. Part of David wants to just be the boss.
- **Non-acceptance pattern (Feb 2026)**: David identified that a huge amount of his energy goes to not accepting Tom's way of working and trying to change it — getting annoyed when it doesn't match how he'd want it. Recognizes this as his default control pattern applied to work relationships. His aspiration: do his own thing, let Tom do his, collaborate when it flows, let it be when it doesn't.
- **David's ambivalence (Feb 2026)**: Actively playing with the idea of doing his next startup solo (post-PetRadar exit). Enjoys working with Tom and recognizes his value, but keeps wondering what it would be like without the friction. Key self-awareness: worries that removing friction could be the "emperor removing everyone who disagrees" trap — surrounding yourself with yes-men always ends badly. The friction Tom provides might actually be beneficial precisely *because* it's uncomfortable.
- **Boundary set (Feb 2026)**: David told Tom his girlfriend keeps crashing their calls and that's not okay. Accepted Tom's need to be with his girlfriend but drew a line on work calls being interrupted.

## To discuss
- **AI-assisted refactoring workflow**: Use the full context window to ask AI for refactors — it discovers its own pain points naturally (like a human dev would), and can write tests from that same context
- **Career direction: engineering vs business** — David's growing pull toward building technically hard products vs the business-heavy work at PetRadar. Where does Tom stand on this? How does it affect PetRadar's future and what comes after?

## History
- Used to have long nights debating together — those were a lot of fun. The friendship predates the work relationship by many years.
