# Family

## Dad
- Entrepreneur — very motivated, driven, creative. Works extreme hours (16+ hour days, all-nighters are normal)
- Came from a family of 7 children where the parents were unhappy together and there was a lot of fighting — he tries to avoid conflict as a result
- Inspiring and appreciated by many for his work ethic and uniqueness
- Lacks social skills / empathy — doesn't seem to empathize much with David's experience or needs
- Barges into conversations, says controversial and provocative things — David reads this as attention-seeking behavior
- David recognizes many of these patterns in himself: the conversational barging, the provocative persona, the drive

## Mom
- Depressed for most of David's childhood
- David's #1 goal as a child was to make her happy — he ended up parenting her (reading her emotional state, guessing what she needed, trying to manage her wellbeing)
- Parents fought a lot; money was a significant source of tension
- Felt stressed and uncomfortable about David earning his own money for a school trip (because it highlighted the financial struggle)
- Government budget applications (e.g. for David's sports) caused her so much stress that David eventually stopped asking for things

## Sister
- Something traumatic happened between David and his sister in childhood — he doesn't want to go into detail
- Left David feeling very guilty and with a bad self-image — has felt at times like he was "a monster" to his sister and mother
- This guilt pattern is still quite present and something he's actively trying to overcome
