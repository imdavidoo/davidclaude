# David — Character & Personality

## Basics
- 28 years old, born 3 November 1997
- Dutch, lives in Amsterdam with girlfriend Ira
- Speaks Dutch natively but prefers English for assistant interactions (even when he sends messages in Dutch)

## Core traits
- **Builder mindset** — Loves progressing, creating, and building things (in work and life). Drawn to stories about building something from nothing.
- **Achievement-driven** — Puts pressure on himself to perform and progress. Driven individual who genuinely enjoys achieving things — this won't go away, only the unhealthy overdrive needs to go.
- **Founder energy** — Several years into PetRadar; entrepreneurial, hands-on. Title is CEO but day-to-day is mostly front-end coding and product development. Increasingly drawn to engineering over business — wants to build things that are technically hard, not just operationally demanding.
- **Practical thinker** — Prefers things that feel grounded and believable over abstract/fantastical.
- **Autonomy-oriented** — Functions best when he can choose his own rhythm and move freely rather than depending on group schedules or rigid external structures.
- **Skill-progression seeker** — Naturally drawn to activities with visible milestones that give novelty, mastery, and aliveness rather than just discipline.

## Emotional patterns & challenges
- **"Hank" — the inner critic** — Near-constant strict inner voice telling him he's doing something wrong. Named in therapy (Feb 2026). Creates background tension that likely amplifies physical pain too. See `growth/insights.md` for details.
- **Chronic daily tension headaches** — worsen with stress and tension; may be partly driven by Hank's constant vigilance
- **Overthinking & self-monitoring** — Interprets small social signals harshly, doubts himself, creates heaviness that prevents feeling safe or relaxed
- **Internal pressure & restlessness** — Often operates from a mental mode that pushes him to perform, structure himself, and follow rules instead of listening to what he actually needs
- **Social anxiety** — Not a skill problem; comes from constricting and shrinking when self-doubt kicks in
- **Guilt & shame** — Carries these as a way of trying to be a better person, but they actually fuel overdrive, social anxiety, and non-strategic emotional actions
- **Deeper identity fear** — Sense that something is fundamentally wrong with him socially; makes even small interactions feel intense and confirm self-doubt

## Root pattern
Childhood left him feeling out of control and in pain → developed a coping mechanism of trying to control everything (business outcomes, finances, others' behavior, whether things work "correctly"). When outcomes don't align with expectations, experiences intense anger and tension. This pattern helped him achieve things but now creates chronic tension, headaches, and pulls him away from what he actually cares about. The healthiest shift: focus on inputs and efforts rather than outcomes he can't control.

## Social self
- **When relaxed and safe**: warm, soft, humorous, fun — genuinely easy to be around
- **When anxious**: constricts, tenses up, shrinks, overthinks
- **Gravitates toward**: people who are light, friendly, non-judgmental — and wants to become more like that himself
- **Tendency**: imagines what people expect and feels pressure to fulfill those imagined expectations before they're expressed. Healthier to stay neutral and choose actions deliberately.

## Values & life philosophy
- **Core goals**: be connected and build something meaningful
- **Financial stability** matters because it protects those goals, but extreme obsession with achieving it is counterproductive for happiness, connection, and meaningful work
- **Wants to live from**: joy, pleasure, feeling alive and connected — not just pushing, performing, being responsible
- **Inner voice goal**: speak to himself like someone on his own team. Two check questions: "Does this sound like I'm on my own team?" and "Would I speak this way to someone I love?"
- **Already doing enough** — working hard, trying, caring. Doesn't need to be perfect or control every outcome. If he lets go of the pressure-driven 40% and focuses on what he genuinely cares about, he'll still accomplish most of what matters while feeling lighter.
- **Life feels short** — wants to choose activities that make life feel real, meaningful, and lived rather than losing time to numbing distraction
- **The real world nourishes more than screens** — nature and physical engagement make him feel more alive

## Work philosophy
- Wants to work from strategy, not fear. The fear that "if I don't push really hard, things will go wrong" is a signal to process first, then make deliberate decisions.
- When recovering from work: not just recovering but investing in personal life. Needs to give himself permission to not think about work during rest.
- The fear-driven obsession creates the very tension and anxiety that prevent clear strategic decisions and quality time with people.

## Energy & rest
- Relaxes best with a balanced mix of full rest, gentle activity, and meaningful stimulation
- Too much cognitive activity → burnout; too much rest → void/spiral
- Full rest is helpful for emotional processing only when intentional and limited
- Unstructured downtime is destabilizing — even loose structure helps
- Cheap dopamine (YouTube, short-form content) almost always turns addictive: starts as inspiration, becomes default escape, creates disconnection
- **Screen time rule**: allowed screen time = half the minutes exercised that day. Working well since ~Dec 2025. See `growth/techniques.md` for details.
- **Crash pattern**: when sleep-deprived + emotionally overloaded + depleted, the system breaks down — skips workout, binges content, can't start tasks. Recognizes it, doesn't beat himself up about it, but it's a signal the foundation was gone. Recovery: sleep, lower expectations for the day, show up at 50%.

## Empathy & connection
- Social contact is deeply nourishing even when it triggers anxiety — makes him feel grounded, loved, stimulated. Worth actively seeking.
- Empathy practice: shift from "what do I say next" to genuine presence. Listen, look, feel. Let there be a 2-second pause after someone finishes speaking. No need to think ahead.
- Healthy empathy comes from relaxation and a grounded self, not from insecurity or approval-seeking.
- Being with people naturally reveals who both people are — no techniques needed, just presence and attention.
- Best gift to parents: spending time and connecting with them.

## Body signals
- Listening to body signals is almost always right but can be difficult
- Strong signals are gentle cues for small adjustments, not extreme commands (overwhelmed ≠ lie down all day; it means take a 10-second pause and have awareness)
- When trying to slow down or listen inwardly, sometimes falls into anxiety/emptiness/self-doubt — trusting internal signals is a work in progress
- "What do I need in the next few minutes?" is more manageable than deciding for a whole day

## Emotional regulation (Robert Greene — Laws of Human Nature)
- When overtaken by strong, urgent, irrational emotion: do not act immediately. Step back, calm, let it pass, process, then decide from groundedness. Wise strategic action vs impulsive reaction.
- Emotion is helpful as a signal but dangerous to act upon immediately. See it, use it, but from deliberate choice.
- All humans have some narcissism. Those who lack an inner foundation of self-worth become dependent on external approval. Cultivating stable inner self-worth → less insecurity, less validation-seeking, more attention on what truly matters (work and relationships).

## Health, fitness & longevity
- **Growing interest in health, longevity, nutrition, and sleep** — becoming a real focus area
- Inspired by Philip (health/nutrition/sleep), Ira (fitness/running discipline), and own desire to become a truly healthy, fit person
- Feels like he's genuinely getting there — this is a positive momentum area
- Active daily: midday cardio (running, cycling, swimming) + calisthenics micro-habits throughout the day
- Integrates exercise into work flow — short sets during work, meals, breaks
- Has gymnastics rings at home
- Practicing pistol squats (working on ankle flexion)
- Enjoys bodyweight/calisthenics over gym equipment
- Hobby: salsa dancing
- **Adaptive zone**: consistent 40-100% beats pushing 130%. Hard pushing → extended recovery. Consistent showing up → better results. Applies to work and life too.

## To do when back in Netherlands
- Get a hearing test
- Try the Goggins max-distance run experiment (details in `sports/_index.md`)
- Plant a gooseberry (kruisbes) on the balcony

## To buy (general — no rush)
- Sandals — Teva-style, sturdy outdoor sandals
- Barefoot shoes — versatile for everyday, running, and light water exposure (e.g. Vivobarefoot, Merrell Vapor Glove)
- Waterproof barefoot running shoes
- Daypack

## Tools & gear
- **Whoop** — wearable fitness/recovery tracker
- **Charachorder** — alternative keyboard using chord-based typing. Built a custom chord library over ~3 weeks (Feb 2026). Much deeper and harder than expected. Believes it's the right long-term investment for a better computer interface, but also uncertain. Currently pausing to integrate it into daily use. Next phase: integration into actual workflow (post-Argentina).

## Travel preferences
- **Walking-first** — David & Ira prefer exploring cities on foot. Long walks across neighborhoods are part of the experience, not just transit.
- **Active exploration** — fits their fitness-oriented lifestyle; walking 1.5+ hours to a destination is normal and enjoyable.

## Entertainment preferences
- **Two watching modes**: solo (less frequent — actively limits solo screen time) and with Ira (more frequent)
- Struggles with pure sci-fi — hard to suspend disbelief when it gets too out-there
- Enjoys post-apocalyptic / survival themes when they focus on society-building and human dynamics (e.g. liked early seasons of *The 100*)
- More drawn to the "how do people organize and build" angle than the sci-fi setting itself
- **Solo**: drawn to power, success, ambition themes. Smart, powerful characters with strong personalities and character development (Suits, Billions)
- **With Ira**: enjoys strong/smart lead characters, crime/thriller-adjacent (The Mentalist, Jack Ryan)
- Notices when shows decline in quality over seasons (Jack Ryan)
