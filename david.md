# David — Character & Personality

## Basics
- 28 years old, born 3 November 1997
- Dutch, lives in Amsterdam with girlfriend Ira
- Speaks Dutch natively but prefers English for assistant interactions (even when he sends messages in Dutch)

## Upbringing
- Grew up in poverty in the Netherlands — social security covered basics, but money was very tight (buying a sandwich was considered a luxury)
- Parents fought a lot; financial stress was a major source of tension
- Missed typical childhood experiences (classmates went to Disneyland Paris, etc.) — went to a theme park once or twice total
- Wanted to earn his own money from a young age — to reduce the financial burden on parents and gain independence
- Paid for his own school trip as a kid because parents couldn't afford it
- When asked as a child what he wanted to be: "millionaire" — driven by the experience of financial scarcity
- Couldn't do sports growing up because it was too expensive; stopped asking because the hassle stressed his mom
- Parented his mother through her depression — constantly reading her emotional state, trying to make her happy
- As a child, was "the weird one" in class — performed and said provocative things for reactions (pattern inherited from father) rather than being authentic. Never had real friends; was playing a character.
- Looking back, wishes he'd been able to just be himself and build genuine confidence
- See `people/family.md` for detailed family dynamics

## Core traits
- **Builder mindset** — Loves progressing, creating, and building things (in work and life). Drawn to stories about building something from nothing. This goes back to childhood: was already making board games (Monopoly) and projects with friends as a kid. Believes childhood interests are a strong indicator of what you actually enjoy as an adult.
- **Achievement-driven** — Puts pressure on himself to perform and progress. Driven individual who genuinely enjoys achieving things — this won't go away, only the unhealthy overdrive needs to go.
- **Founder energy** — Several years into PetRadar; entrepreneurial, hands-on. Title is CEO but day-to-day is mostly front-end coding and product development. Increasingly drawn to engineering over business — wants to build things that are technically hard, not just operationally demanding.
- **Practical thinker** — Prefers things that feel grounded and believable over abstract/fantastical.
- **Autonomy-oriented** — Functions best when he can choose his own rhythm and move freely rather than depending on group schedules or rigid external structures.
- **Skill-progression seeker** — Naturally drawn to activities with visible milestones that give novelty, mastery, and aliveness rather than just discipline.
- **ADHD** — Diagnosed. Has worked around it significantly, but people still notice he seems distracted in conversations.
- **Possibly gifted** — Psychologist raised it; parents didn't pursue testing. Was almost always one of the smartest in class, hung out with the gifted kids. Read a book on giftedness that strongly resonated — particularly around frustration with others' low effort/motivation and high ethical standards.

## Emotional patterns & challenges
- **"Hank" — the inner critic** — Near-constant strict inner voice telling him he's doing something wrong. Named in therapy (Feb 2026). Creates background tension that likely amplifies physical pain too. See `growth/insights.md` for details.
- **Chronic daily tension headaches** — worsen with stress and tension; may be partly driven by Hank's constant vigilance
- **Overthinking & self-monitoring** — Interprets small social signals harshly, doubts himself, creates heaviness that prevents feeling safe or relaxed
- **Internal pressure & restlessness** — Often operates from a mental mode that pushes him to perform, structure himself, and follow rules instead of listening to what he actually needs
- **Social anxiety** — Not a skill problem; comes from constricting and shrinking when self-doubt kicks in
- **Guilt & shame** — Carries these as a way of trying to be a better person, but they actually fuel overdrive, social anxiety, and non-strategic emotional actions. A significant source: childhood events with his sister left deep guilt and a "monster" self-image (see `people/family.md`).
- **Fairness obsession & scorekeeping** — Strongly wants things to be fair. Tracks how much effort he puts in vs. others and feels hurt when the balance is off. "I'm putting so much effort and you're not." Feeds into resentment when others don't reciprocate appreciation or commitment. Connected to the control pattern and the CEO performance (see `recent/2026-02-27.md`).
- **Deeper identity fear** — Sense that something is fundamentally wrong with him socially; makes even small interactions feel intense and confirm self-doubt. Roots in childhood: felt different, unappreciated, not loved/cared for.

## Root pattern
Childhood left him feeling out of control and in pain → developed a coping mechanism of trying to control everything (business outcomes, finances, others' behavior, whether things work "correctly"). When outcomes don't align with expectations, experiences intense anger and tension. This pattern helped him achieve things but now creates chronic tension, headaches, and pulls him away from what he actually cares about. The healthiest shift: focus on inputs and efforts rather than outcomes he can't control.

## Social self
- **When relaxed and safe**: warm, soft, humorous, fun — genuinely easy to be around. People who get to know him describe him as loving, kind, and caring.
- **When anxious/insecure**: constricts, tenses up, shrinks, overthinks. Defaults to a hard, performative, proving-himself mode — more detached and critical.
- **The shift takes time**: usually needs to spend days in a row with someone before the soft David emerges. Before that, social interaction often gives him headaches rather than nourishment.
- **Gravitates toward**: people who are light, friendly, non-judgmental — and wants to become more like that himself
- **Tendency**: imagines what people expect and feels pressure to fulfill those imagined expectations before they're expressed. Healthier to stay neutral and choose actions deliberately.
- **Critical & high-bar**: Very critical toward both himself and others. Can get frustrated when people don't try hard enough or seem to accept low standards / immoral behavior. Recognizes this can make him not the easiest person to be around.
- **Conversational pattern**: Sometimes barges into people's conversations or spaces without waiting — recognizes this as an inherited pattern from his father.

## Values & life philosophy
- **Core goals**: be connected and build something meaningful
- **Wants to live from**: joy, pleasure, feeling alive and connected — not just pushing, performing, being responsible
- **Life feels short** — wants to choose activities that make life feel real, meaningful, and lived rather than losing time to numbing distraction
- **The real world nourishes more than screens** — nature and physical engagement make him feel more alive
- See `growth/insights.md` for detailed principles on work, guilt/shame, energy, and self-compassion
- See `growth/techniques.md` for named practices (inner voice check, emotional pause, screen time rule, etc.)

## Health, fitness & longevity
- Growing interest in health, longevity, nutrition, and sleep — becoming a real focus area
- Inspired by Philip (health/nutrition/sleep), Ira (fitness/running discipline), and own desire to become a truly healthy, fit person
- Enjoys bodyweight/calisthenics over gym equipment. Hobby: salsa dancing.
- See `sports/_index.md` for routine, exercises, and experiments

## Tools & gear
- **Whoop** — wearable fitness/recovery tracker
- **Charachorder** — alternative keyboard using chord-based typing. Built a custom chord library over ~3 weeks (Feb 2026). Believes it's the right long-term investment but uncertain. Next phase: integration into actual workflow (post-Argentina).

## Entertainment preferences
See `entertainment/watchlist.md` for specific titles.
- **Two watching modes**: solo (less frequent — actively limits solo screen time) and with Ira (more frequent)
- **Solo**: drawn to power, success, ambition themes. Smart, powerful characters with strong personalities (Suits, Billions)
- **With Ira**: enjoys strong/smart lead characters, crime/thriller-adjacent (The Mentalist, Jack Ryan)
- Struggles with pure sci-fi; enjoys post-apocalyptic themes when they focus on society-building and human dynamics
