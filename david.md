# David — Character & Personality

## Core traits
- **Builder mindset** — Loves progressing, creating, and building things (in work and life). Drawn to stories about building something from nothing (e.g. societies emerging, startups growing).
- **Founder energy** — Several years into PetRadar; entrepreneurial, hands-on.
- **Practical thinker** — Prefers things that feel grounded and believable over abstract/fantastical.

## Fitness & movement
- Active daily: midday cardio (running, cycling, swimming) + calisthenics micro-habits throughout the day
- Integrates exercise into work flow — short sets during work, meals, breaks
- Has gymnastics rings at home
- Practicing pistol squats (working on ankle flexion)
- Enjoys bodyweight/calisthenics over gym equipment

## Entertainment preferences
- **Two watching modes**: solo (less frequent — actively limits solo screen time) and with Ira (more frequent)
- Struggles with pure sci-fi — hard to suspend disbelief when it gets too out-there
- Enjoys post-apocalyptic / survival themes when they focus on society-building and human dynamics (e.g. liked early seasons of *The 100*)
- More drawn to the "how do people organize and build" angle than the sci-fi setting itself
- **Solo**: drawn to power, success, ambition themes. Smart, powerful characters with strong personalities and character development (Suits, Billions)
- **With Ira**: enjoys strong/smart lead characters, crime/thriller-adjacent (The Mentalist, Jack Ryan)
- Notices when shows decline in quality over seasons (Jack Ryan)
