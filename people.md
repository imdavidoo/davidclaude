# People — Important Relationships

## Ira (girlfriend)
- **Age**: 27

## Tom (friend & co-founder)
- **Known for**: ~13 years (since ~2013)
- **Age**: 28 (same as David)
- **Role**: Co-founder of PetRadar
- **Personality**: Calm, rational, stable
- **Girlfriend**: Has health issues (as of Feb 2026), which sometimes explains Tom's withdrawal/unavailability
- **Strengths**: Rationality is genuinely helpful. Models healthy work-life balance — he can let go and stop pushing in ways David can't, and sometimes that's genuinely inspiring
- **Communication**: Not great at communicating when something personal is going on. David initially reads withdrawal as disengagement, but it's usually something behind the scenes. David has to ask directly to find out.
- **Core tension with David**: David pushes relentlessly and can't let go; Tom is measured and can. This creates two opposite reactions in David:
  - *Positive*: Tom's approach inspires David to ease up, and when David actually lets go too, it often feels surprisingly nice
  - *Frustration*: Feels like a mismatch in commitment. "I'm pushing so hard and you're just... not." David knows intellectually that Tom's stability might actually produce better results, but emotionally it's hard.
- **Boundary set (Feb 2026)**: David told Tom his girlfriend keeps crashing their calls and that's not okay. Accepted Tom's need to be with his girlfriend but drew a line on work calls being interrupted.
- **History**: Used to have long nights debating together — those were a lot of fun. The friendship predates the work relationship by many years.

## Fen (cousin)
- **Relationship**: Cousin, known for a long time
- **Profession**: Filmmaker
- **Life stage**: Recently married, has a kid now
- **Shared history**: Used to do a lot of life-hacking, ambitious goal-setting, and self-improvement stuff together
- **Current**: Both a bit more settled, less extreme than before — but Fen is still driven, ambitious, and motivated
- **Bond**: A kindred spirit in the ambition/growth space

## Philip (new friend)
- **How they met**: Co-founder of Breeze (dating app where David used to work)
- **Personality**: Very rational, very driven
- **Inner world**: Often feels like he's not good enough (something David can relate to)
- **Relationship with David**: Seems to genuinely care about David — David doesn't always understand why, but is learning to accept and believe it
- **Shared activities**: Sports together (with David and Shan)
- **Inspiration**: Health, longevity, nutrition, sleep — Philip is a role model on the health/longevity front

## Shan
- Sports buddy (with Philip and David)
- Details TBD
