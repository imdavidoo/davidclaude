# Daily Structure (Micro-Habit Based)

Structure helps David stay grounded and keep energy stable, but rigidity breaks it. This routine is built entirely around micro-habits: for every activity, do the smallest possible first step. Continue if you want; stop if you don't — both are fine.

## Morning (~06:15)
- Shower (micro: step in)
- Brush teeth + gratitude (micro: 1 second)

## Food blocks (every ~3.5h)
- Calisthenics (micro: 1 rep)
- Intuitive eating — focus on high carbs/protein/fiber/nutrients, low in fats but healthy ones (micro: 1 bite)
- Optional: meditation nap (micro: lay down, close eyes)
- Take first step of next activity

## Cardio (~15:30)
- Goal: transition between work and rest
- Micro: tiny run/ride/whatever

## Evening
- Free time, some options:
  - Focus on rest/recovery
  - Spend time with Ira
  - Spend time with friends
  - Hobby (salsa dancing)

## Bedtime (~21:00–21:30)
- Normal bedtime: ~21:30, normal wake: ~06:15
- Low engagement activities
- Habit tracker (micro: swipable habits)
- Brush teeth + pleasure/joy (micro: 1 second)
- Yoga/meditation (micro: prepare and sit down)

## Key principles
- **Adaptive zone**: consistent 40-100% effort beats pushing 130%. Hard pushing extends recovery time. Consistent showing up → better long-term results. Applies to work and personal projects too.
- **Unstructured downtime is hard** — even loose structure makes free time feel nourishing rather than overwhelming.
