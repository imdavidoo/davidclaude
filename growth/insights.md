# Key Insights & Principles

Learnings David has identified about how he works best. These are hypotheses and experiments — living observations, not fixed rules.

## Energy management
- Relaxes best with balanced mix of full rest, gentle activity, and meaningful stimulation
- Too much cognitive activity → burnout; too much rest → void/spiral inward
- Full rest helps emotional processing only when intentional and limited; excessive rest becomes destabilizing
- Cheap dopamine (YouTube, short-form) always shifts from helpful to addictive — starts as inspiration, becomes default escape, creates disconnection from real life
- When depleted + unresolved emotions + no sleep, the crash into hours of short-form content is almost inevitable. The rule helps prevent this on normal days, but can't hold when the foundation (sleep, energy, emotional clarity) is gone.
- The real world nourishes more than screens — nature and physical engagement create aliveness and connection

## Social connection
- Social contact is deeply nourishing even when it triggers anxiety — makes him grounded, loved, stimulated, and he learns from people. Worth actively seeking.
- Challenges in social situations come from constricting/tensing/shrinking when self-doubt kicks in, not from lack of skill
- When safe and valued: naturally warm, soft, humorous, fun, easy to be around
- Gravitates toward light, friendly, non-judgmental people — wants to grow toward being that kind of person
- Tendency to imagine others' expectations and feel pressure to fulfill them before they're expressed → healthier to stay neutral and choose deliberately

## Empathy (healthy version)
- Not about asking many questions or going deep on purpose — it's about genuine attention: listening, looking, feeling with presence
- Shift from "what do I say next" to being in the conversation. Pay attention to the moment instead of thinking ahead.
- Let there be a ~2 second pause after someone finishes speaking. Feel and receive what they said. They'll either continue or you respond with whatever comes to mind.
- Healthy empathy comes from relaxation and a grounded self — not from insecurity or approval-seeking (which makes it performative and draining)
- Spending time with people naturally builds understanding — no special technique needed

## Self-awareness becoming self-absorption
- Noticed increasing self-absorption and declining social ease
- The antidote: genuine curiosity toward others, practiced from relaxation not insecurity
- Past pattern: used empathy to earn approval → performative, tense, disconnected from self
- Key difference: healthy empathy expands the world; approval-seeking empathy drains it

## Work & achievement
- Often operates from deep fear rather than strategy — "if I don't push really hard, things will go wrong"
- Fear is a signal to process first, then make a deliberate strategic decision
- Core goals: connection + building something meaningful. Financial stability supports these but obsessing over it undermines them.
- Rest time = investing in personal life. Permission to fully disconnect from work during rest is both good for life AND good for work.
- Won't stop being driven if he lets go of overdrive — he genuinely enjoys achieving things. Only the unhealthy part goes away.

## Guilt, shame & control
- Carries guilt and shame as attempt to be a better person — but they actually fuel overdrive, social anxiety, and emotional (non-strategic) actions
- Childhood → need to control everything → intense anger when outcomes don't match expectations → chronic tension and headaches
- Letting go of the pressure-driven 40% of effort and keeping the inspired 60% → still accomplishes most of what matters, but lighter and more alive
- Already doing a lot. That is enough. Doesn't need to be perfect or control every outcome.

## Body & intuition
- Listening to body signals is almost always right but currently difficult
- Body and intuition are the healthiest guide, but fully following those signals can be overwhelming right now
- Strong signals = gentle cues for small adjustments, not extreme commands
- Slowing down or listening inwardly sometimes triggers anxiety/emptiness/self-doubt — trusting internal signals is a work in progress
- Often operates from a mode that pushes to perform and follow rules, instead of listening to actual needs

## The "50% > 0%" principle
- Seed insight (Feb 2026): You don't have to be perfect to show up. Showing up at 50% beats staying home at 0%. Like being vegan but still eating bacon — imperfect action massively beats no action.
- Applies to fitness, work, habits, everything. On a depleted day, "showed up and did stuff" is a win, not a failure.

## Environment & reflection
- Being in a different environment (holiday, travel) helps condense recent experiences, reflect on life, gain clarity, reconnect with motivations — even when the trip isn't ideal
