# Techniques & Tools

Named practices David uses for grounding, self-compassion, and emotional regulation.

## The loved one reframe
Ask: "How would I speak to someone I love in this situation?" Helps evaluate situations more fairly and access actual compassion instead of harsh self-judgment.

## The 10-minute question
When overwhelmed or uncertain: "What do I need in the next few minutes?" Stays present and grounded without getting overwhelmed by bigger timeframes.

## The emotional pause
When strong, urgent, irrational emotion hits and creates the urge to act immediately: do not act. Step back → calm → let it pass → process → decide from groundedness. Wise strategic action vs impulsive reaction. Emotion is a signal to use deliberately, not to be lived by.

## Micro-habits as structure
Use tiny first steps for activities (smallest possible version, almost no effort). Maintains beneficial structure without rigidity. Easy to start, freedom to continue or stop without pressure.

## Needs identification and balancing
Deliberately name different needs clearly, then find a way to balance them. Helps when competing needs create confusion or paralysis.

## Inner voice check (two questions)
1. "Does this sound like I'm on my own team?"
2. "Would I speak this way to someone I love?"

## Feedback framing
When receiving feedback: "I'm interested in what you have to say and I think it could help me grow, but I'll only really be able to hear it if it sounds like you're on my team." Same principle applies to inner dialogue.

## Screen time rule (the half-rule)
Allowed screen time (YouTube, short-form content) = half the minutes spent exercising that day. 1hr sport → 30min screen. Has been working well since ~Dec 2025. Simple, concrete, tied to something positive. Doesn't hold when the foundation collapses (no sleep, depleted, emotional overload) — but on normal days it's effective at keeping the dopamine trap in check.
