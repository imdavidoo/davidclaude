# Travel Preferences & Learnings

## Accommodation
- **Always check for a kitchen or microwave** — David and Ira eat a lot of veggies and prefer cooking/heating healthy food from the supermarket rather than eating out every meal. They enjoy eating out once every couple of days, not daily. Without kitchen access (learned the hard way in El Chaltén), you're forced to eat out constantly.
- Hostels with private rooms are a nice sweet spot — hostel vibe, but personal space.

## Packing
- **Pack extremely light** — sports/athletic clothing is the move:
  - Lighter than normal clothes
  - Quick-drying
  - Works for both sports and daily wear
- **Wash-as-you-go system**: shower with your clothes using shampoo (works as detergent) or bring laundry detergent pods from home / buy locally. Hang to dry overnight → clean and dry by next day.
- Cycle through ~3 sets of clothing. That's all you need.
- Packing light = more bag space, minimal weight, less hassle deciding what to bring.

## Booking strategy
- **For wave/weather-dependent trips (surfing especially)**: don't book months in advance. Instead, mentally plan the trip, give colleagues a heads-up, and book short-notice (a few days out) when conditions look good. David has the flexibility at work to do this.
  - Learned from Morocco: booked 2 weeks months ahead, arrived to zero swell. Entire trip wasted.
- **Mountain/hiking trips**: similar principle might apply (weather windows), though harder when Ira needs to book holiday in advance.

## Travel style
- **Walking-first** — David & Ira prefer exploring cities on foot. Long walks across neighborhoods are part of the experience, not just transit.
- **Active exploration** — fits their fitness-oriented lifestyle; walking 1.5+ hours to a destination is normal and enjoyable.
- **Hiking-oriented** — David loves hiking for the exploration, physical challenge, and conquering personal limits. Seeks destinations with good trail access.
