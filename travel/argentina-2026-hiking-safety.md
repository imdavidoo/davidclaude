# Hiking Safety — Patagonia & Bariloche

## The #1 Rule
**Start early.** Before 6 AM for big hikes. Morning = calmer wind, clearer skies, fewer people. Patagonia weather deteriorates through the day.

## Weather
- "Four seasons in one day" is real — sun, wind, rain, even snow can happen in hours
- **Wind** is the main danger: gusts regularly exceed 100 km/h on exposed sections in Chalten
- Late Feb/early March is good timing: warmest temps, longest daylight (14–17 hrs), slightly less wind than Dec/Jan
- Check weather forecasts daily; ask your accommodation for local conditions
- **Always set a turnaround time and stick to it**, even if you're close to the goal

## Water
- **Do NOT drink untreated stream water** — giardia risk is real (invasive beavers contaminate waterways)
- Options: bring enough water (2L+ per person), or carry a filter (LifeStraw, Sawyer, or similar with ≤0.3 micron pore)
- Symptoms of giardia appear 1–9 days after: severe diarrhea, cramps, nausea

## What to Carry on Every Day Hike
- Waterproof shell + warm mid-layer (even if it looks sunny at the trailhead)
- Sunscreen, sunglasses, hat (UV is intense, especially near glaciers)
- Buff/neck gaiter for wind
- 2L+ water per person
- Snacks/lunch
- Headlamp (in case you're out longer than planned)
- Basic first aid: blister plasters, ibuprofen, bandage
- Phone charged + offline maps downloaded (no cell reception on trails)
- Trekking poles (rent locally)

## By Location

### El Chalten
- **Registration**: Mandatory free registration at Parque Nacional office on Av. Güemes before first hike
- **Entry fee**: ~$30,000 ARS for non-nationals at trailhead toll booth (check current rate — Argentine prices fluctuate)
- **Laguna de los Tres (Fitz Roy)**: ~20 km, 8–10 hrs. Final 1 km is steep rocky scramble. The big one.
- **Laguna Torre**: ~18 km, 7–8 hrs. Less steep but still long.
- Trails well-marked in summer. High foot traffic on main routes.
- **No mountain rescue helicopter** in the area. No cell reception on trails. Tell your accommodation your plan before leaving.

### El Calafate (Perito Moreno Glacier)
- Glacier viewing is mostly safe boardwalks
- **Ice trekking**: only with organized tour guides who provide crampons/gear. Never go on ice independently.
- Age restriction for Big Ice trek: 18–50 years old, medical form required
- Tours cancelled in high wind — have a backup plan for that day
- Better infrastructure and cell coverage than Chalten

### Bariloche
- **Registration**: Free online registration with Nahuel Huapi National Park (or at park office in town)
- **No park entry fee**
- **Refugio Frey**: 5–8 hrs ascent, loose rock on descent — take it slow going down
- **Cerro López**: Limited water sources until the refugio — carry enough water
- Snow can linger on higher trails even in late summer — check current conditions at park office
- Same rescue limitations: no helicopter, limited cell coverage in mountains

## Emergency Contacts
- Download offline: park office locations, accommodation phone numbers
- Consider getting a local SIM (Claro has best Patagonia coverage) for use in towns
- In true emergency in town: 911 works in Argentina
