## Choosing friction over escape

- Deep reflection on the tension between wanting solo autonomy and going back to working with people
- Identified the split clearly: looks forward to building cool projects, dreads interpersonal hassle
- Recognized the solo founder fantasy is partly avoidance of unfinished emotional patterns
- Made a deliberate commitment: use the current situation (returning to PetRadar) to understand and overcome the people friction, rather than escaping it
- Plans to explore in future sessions: what specifically causes the friction and how to change the pattern
- See `growth/insights.md` (Work & achievement) and `work/startup-insights.md` (Solo founder)

## Deeper analysis: what the solo fantasy is really about

- The appeal of working solo boils down to: no communication, no alignment, no approval/judgment/disapproval from anyone. "I can just do what I want to do, and what I do is good."
- With employees (vs co-founders), if people have too much friction with his way of working, he can remove them. With Tom as an equal, that's not possible (nor wanted).
- Alex aligns more with Tom's relaxed style, which creates additional friction with David's driven approach
- Core emotional pain: "I am a powerhouse, and whenever I am being a powerhouse, I feel like they dislike me for that." Missing appreciation, feeling like a bother.
- But then challenged his own narrative: Alex *does* push hard when given tasks in her domain. Tom's steady approach has genuinely been inspiring and leads to a more grounded life. Different people, different strengths.
- Working style archetypes emerged: David = the lion (sprint/recover), Tom = the stable engine, Alex = high performer in her skill zone
- See new sections in `growth/insights.md` (Process over results, Working style archetypes) and new file `people/alex.md`

## Hank: reassurance-seeking pattern (Ruben insight)

- Therapist Ruben identified a pattern: David constantly double-checks with people whether what he's doing is alright — a response to Hank's attacks
- Interpersonal friction is fertile ground for Hank: other people become mirrors that can confirm "you're doing it wrong"
- The solo fantasy connects to this: no people = no mirrors = no one to confirm Hank's narrative
- See updated Hank section in `growth/insights.md`

## Naming the friction: non-acceptance and control

- Following up on the "choosing friction over escape" commitment — now identifying what the friction actually *is*
- Most of the friction = trying to get team members to be or do what he wants them to be or do
- Specifically: not accepting Tom's way of working, wanting to change it, being super annoyed when it doesn't match how David would like it
- That's where a lot of his energy is going — and it's mostly negative energy
- His ideal: do his thing, let them do theirs. If collaboration is nice, great. If not, let it be.
- Recognizes this as his "default pattern" — to try to control how others work. Doesn't fully understand why he does it yet.
- Sees that dropping this pattern could save him a lot of energy

## The CEO performance and dropping it

- David puts a lot of effort into "being CEO" — aligning everyone, getting agreement, making finances visible, praising people in weeklies. Questions whether the team is even big enough for all that.
- It's not paying off: he doesn't see people doing better work because of it, and he doesn't enjoy it
- Specific frustration: Tom just does what he wants, doesn't bother being "nice," and gets *more* appreciation for it than David does for all his managing/praising effort
- Weeklies: David does a lot of "great job" praising, but Tom and Alex don't reciprocate. Feels one-directional.
- Tired of performing goodness without reciprocity: "I'm a bit tired of trying to be really good and helpful and stuff like that, and then not getting appreciated for that"
- Emerging intention: be more "selfish" like Tom — focus on what he actually wants to do, stop managing everyone's experience, let them figure things out themselves. Frames it as "being more real with who I am"
- Connects to the Hank/approval-seeking pattern: the CEO performance may partly be a way of earning approval, and dropping it could be genuinely healthy *or* could be reactive withdrawal from resentment

## Process over results (new insight)

- Good work every day → great results over time. Chasing results can mean focusing on wrong things.
- When David pushes extremely hard one day, he often burns out the next (headache, can't work). Steady progress may outperform intensity spikes.
- See new section in `growth/insights.md`

## Goggins "Can't Hurt Me" — Challenge 1

- Reading David Goggins' *Can't Hurt Me* and doing the 10 challenges
- Challenge 1: write out your full life story in "blame mode" — all the excuses and obstacles that have held you back
- Did this as a voice message exercise — went deep on childhood, family dynamics, social patterns, financial hardship, guilt
- Explicitly noted: the "blame mode" framing is just for the exercise, not how he normally talks or feels. Asked KB to store factual information, not frame it as negativity.
- Significant new background info extracted → updated `david.md` (Upbringing section, Core traits, Social self) and `people/family.md`
