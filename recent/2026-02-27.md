## Choosing friction over escape

- Deep reflection on the tension between wanting solo autonomy and going back to working with people
- Identified the split clearly: looks forward to building cool projects, dreads interpersonal hassle
- Recognized the solo founder fantasy is partly avoidance of unfinished emotional patterns
- Made a deliberate commitment: use the current situation (returning to PetRadar) to understand and overcome the people friction, rather than escaping it
- Plans to explore in future sessions: what specifically causes the friction and how to change the pattern
- See `growth/insights.md` (Work & achievement) and `work/startup-insights.md` (Solo founder)
