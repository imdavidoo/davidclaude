## Choosing friction over escape

- Deep reflection on the tension between wanting solo autonomy and going back to working with people
- Identified the split clearly: looks forward to building cool projects, dreads interpersonal hassle
- Recognized the solo founder fantasy is partly avoidance of unfinished emotional patterns
- Made a deliberate commitment: use the current situation (returning to PetRadar) to understand and overcome the people friction, rather than escaping it
- Plans to explore in future sessions: what specifically causes the friction and how to change the pattern
- See `growth/insights.md` (Work & achievement) and `work/startup-insights.md` (Solo founder)

## Deeper analysis: what the solo fantasy is really about

- The appeal of working solo boils down to: no communication, no alignment, no approval/judgment/disapproval from anyone. "I can just do what I want to do, and what I do is good."
- With employees (vs co-founders), if people have too much friction with his way of working, he can remove them. With Tom as an equal, that's not possible (nor wanted).
- Alex aligns more with Tom's relaxed style, which creates additional friction with David's driven approach
- Core emotional pain: "I am a powerhouse, and whenever I am being a powerhouse, I feel like they dislike me for that." Missing appreciation, feeling like a bother.
- But then challenged his own narrative: Alex *does* push hard when given tasks in her domain. Tom's steady approach has genuinely been inspiring and leads to a more grounded life. Different people, different strengths.
- Working style archetypes emerged: David = the lion (sprint/recover), Tom = the stable engine, Alex = high performer in her skill zone

## Hank: reassurance-seeking pattern (Sammy insight)

- Therapist Sammy identified a pattern: David constantly double-checks with people whether what he's doing is alright — a response to Hank's attacks
- Interpersonal friction is fertile ground for Hank: other people become mirrors that can confirm "you're doing it wrong"
- The solo fantasy connects to this: no people = no mirrors = no one to confirm Hank's narrative
- See updated Hank section in `growth/insights.md`

## Naming the friction: non-acceptance and control

- Following up on the "choosing friction over escape" commitment — now identifying what the friction actually *is*
- Most of the friction = trying to get team members to be or do what he wants them to be or do
- Specifically: not accepting Tom's way of working, wanting to change it, being super annoyed when it doesn't match how David would like it
- That's where a lot of his energy is going — and it's mostly negative energy
- His ideal: do his thing, let them do theirs. If collaboration is nice, great. If not, let it be.
- Recognizes this as his "default pattern" — to try to control how others work. Doesn't fully understand why he does it yet.
- Sees that dropping this pattern could save him a lot of energy

## Process over results (new insight)

- Good work every day → great results over time. Chasing results can mean focusing on wrong things.
- When David pushes extremely hard one day, he often burns out the next (headache, can't work). Steady progress may outperform intensity spikes.
- See new section in `growth/insights.md`
