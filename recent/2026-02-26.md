## Steep mountain hike & worry reflection

- Went hiking on a steep mountain in Patagonia. Climbing up was fine (just steep), but at the top: hard wind, rain started, very high and exposed. Mind panicked — "what did we get ourselves into, are we even going to survive, can we get down if it starts raining harder?"
- Going down turned out to be much easier than feared — less wind, less rain, manageable steepness
- Triggered a deep reflection: this pattern repeats across his life. Anticipatory worry is almost always worse than the experience itself.
- Connected it directly to current work anxiety: while on holiday, he feels tension and nervousness about going back to work (fear of unhappiness, conflicts). Recognized this is the same "worrying on top of the mountain" pattern — not useful while on holiday when he doesn't even know what it'll be like.
- Articulated several consolidated insights about worry (now in `growth/insights.md` → "Worry & anticipatory fear"):
  - 90% of worries don't materialize; the things that truly hurt you are usually unanticipated black swans
  - You're more capable of handling things than you think
  - Worry can inform but shouldn't make the decision (Robert Greene connection)
  - "If you have a problem, you have a problem. If you worry about it, you have two problems." (teacher quote)
- Asked to bundle the various worry/fear insights in the KB — done, new consolidated section created

## Travel learnings dump

- Recorded a batch of travel insights and preferences from the Argentina trip:
  - **Accommodation**: always check for kitchen/microwave — hostel in El Chaltén had none, forced to eat out daily (he and Ira prefer cooking veggies most days)
  - **Packing light**: sports clothing + wash-in-shower system, cycle through ~3 sets. Game-changer.
  - **Flexible booking**: for surf trips, book short-notice based on swell instead of months ahead (Morocco lesson)
  - **Hiking & trail running**: loves trail running way more than road running. Walk up, run down. Trekking poles help posture.
  - **Destinations**: wants to go to Albania with Ira; Morocco for surfing
- Created `travel/preferences.md` to capture these as lasting reference
