## Steep mountain hike & worry reflection

- Went hiking on a steep mountain in Patagonia. Climbing up was fine (just steep), but at the top: hard wind, rain started, very high and exposed. Mind panicked — "what did we get ourselves into, are we even going to survive, can we get down if it starts raining harder?"
- Going down turned out to be much easier than feared — less wind, less rain, manageable steepness
- Triggered a deep reflection: this pattern repeats across his life. Anticipatory worry is almost always worse than the experience itself.
- Connected it directly to current work anxiety: while on holiday, he feels tension and nervousness about going back to work (fear of unhappiness, conflicts). Recognized this is the same "worrying on top of the mountain" pattern — not useful while on holiday when he doesn't even know what it'll be like.
- Articulated several consolidated insights about worry (now in `growth/insights.md` → "Worry & anticipatory fear"):
  - 90% of worries don't materialize; the things that truly hurt you are usually unanticipated black swans
  - You're more capable of handling things than you think
  - Worry can inform but shouldn't make the decision (Robert Greene connection)
  - "If you have a problem, you have a problem. If you worry about it, you have two problems." (teacher quote)
- Asked to bundle the various worry/fear insights in the KB — done, new consolidated section created
