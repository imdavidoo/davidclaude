## Patagonia hiking

- Currently in El Chaltén doing hikes
- Did a massive ~40km hike with Ira (including trail running and significant elevation) — thought he could only do 15-20km but pushed through and was only sore next day, not injured
- Key reflection: much of the pain was mental — worry about future injury, not actual damage. Pain decreased once he committed to the route. Worry about "limiting Ira" was also Hank-driven.
- Inspired by this to try a David Goggins-style max-distance run experiment back in the Netherlands

## Hank — inner critic reflection

- Deep reflection on "Hank" (name given in therapy for his strict inner monologue that constantly tells him he's doing something wrong)
- Realized Hank runs almost every moment — creating constant tension
- Hypothesis: Hank doesn't just cause emotional suffering but amplifies/creates physical pain and tension too
- The knee metaphor: past knee injury was caused by a shortened hip muscle twisting the knee — fix was lengthening the muscle, not stopping running. Similarly, Hank (the underlying tension) is the root cause, not life's impacts.
- Woke up with headache → Hank said "don't run" → realized the cautionary thoughts themselves create tension → running without the worry felt freer
- Working on this with psychologist; will be a recurring theme going forward

## Business brainstorming

- Deep brainstorming session about next startup ideas while in Patagonia
- Explored AI product advisor (affiliate model) and press release toolkit (SaaS) — see `work/business-ideas.md`
- Crystallized startup criteria and key principles — see `work/startup-insights.md`
- Core tension: AI-based ideas keep expanding into "general AI assistant" territory where big labs win
