## Patagonia hiking

- Currently in El Chaltén doing hikes
- Experiencing some pain while walking but realizing much of it is mental (worry about future injury rather than actual damage)
- Inspired by this to try a David Goggins-style max-distance run experiment back in the Netherlands

## Business brainstorming

- Deep brainstorming session about next startup ideas while in Patagonia
- Explored AI product advisor (affiliate model) and press release toolkit (SaaS) — see `work/business-ideas.md`
- Crystallized startup criteria and key principles — see `work/startup-insights.md`
- Core tension: AI-based ideas keep expanding into "general AI assistant" territory where big labs win
