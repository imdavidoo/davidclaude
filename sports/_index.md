# Sports & Fitness

## David's routine
- **Midday cardio**: running (primary), cycling, swimming
- **Throughout the day**: micro habits — short calisthenics/bodyweight sets during work, meals, breaks
- Goal: stay active without dedicated long gym sessions; integrate movement into daily flow

## Hiking & trail running
- **Loves hiking** — the exploration, physical demand, and conquering personal limits. Core part of how he likes to travel.
- **Really loves trail running** — finds it much more fun than road running. More varied, more natural, uses more different muscles, has an adrenaline/game-like quality.
- **Hiking + trail running combo**: walk up at a high tempo (heart rate zone 1-2), then run down. The downhill running is the highlight — adrenaline rush.
- **Trekking poles are great** — activates upper body much more. The pushing motion is the exact anti-movement for his hunched-forward posture, helping train the muscles he needs for better posture.
- **Trail running > road running** — would love to do more trail running in the Netherlands but there are basically no trails available.
- Discovered in Patagonia (Feb 2026) during extended hikes with Ira.

## Experiments to try
- **Goggins max-distance run** (Netherlands) — run as far as you can until you genuinely feel you can't do a single step more, then turn around and run home. Worst case: taxi/bus/friend pickup. Inspired by noticing in Patagonia that much of the "pain" while walking is mental — worry about future injury rather than actual current damage. Pushing through makes it less intense. Curious to find where the real physical limit is vs. the mental one.

## Equipment at home
- Gymnastics rings
