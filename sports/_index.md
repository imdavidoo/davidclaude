# Sports & Fitness

## David's routine
- **Midday cardio**: running (primary), cycling, swimming
- **Throughout the day**: micro habits — short calisthenics/bodyweight sets during work, meals, breaks
- Goal: stay active without dedicated long gym sessions; integrate movement into daily flow

## Experiments to try
- **Goggins max-distance run** (Netherlands) — run as far as you can until you genuinely feel you can't do a single step more, then turn around and run home. Worst case: taxi/bus/friend pickup. Inspired by noticing in Patagonia that much of the "pain" while walking is mental — worry about future injury rather than actual current damage. Pushing through makes it less intense. Curious to find where the real physical limit is vs. the mental one.

## Equipment at home
- Gymnastics rings
