# Startup Insights

Reflections and principles about building startups, accumulated from experience and thinking.

## What to look for in a new startup

- **Dedicated user base** — users who come back regularly, not incidental/one-off usage. Contrast with PetRadar where your pet goes missing once every few years.
- **Low acquisition cost** — easy to get users in the door. Free products with indirect monetization (e.g. affiliate) lower the barrier.
- **High retention** — the product should be sticky enough that people keep using it.
- **High lifetime value** — each user generates meaningful revenue over time.
- **Feature request flywheel** — a product where users actively request features (Reddit-style upvoting), and AI-assisted engineering lets you crank them out fast. Users feel heard, product improves rapidly.
- **Mass adoption potential** — a product that can scale to many users, not limited to a niche.

## Key principles

- **Latent demand > new demand** — it's much easier to help people do what they're already doing, but easier/better, than to convince them to do something entirely new. Look for people going out of their way to accomplish something → build a tool that makes it effortless. Don't invent new behaviors; enable existing ones.
- **Avoid competing with big labs on general AI** — any AI product that naturally expands into "general AI assistant" will eventually compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. They will win that race. Niche AI products risk expanding into this trap.
- **Niche AI has a lifespan problem** — you can niche down (e.g. AI just for reflection, AI just for product recommendations) but the big labs will eventually cover those niches too. The moat erodes.
- **B2B + clear value prop can work** — selling to companies who already spend money on the problem (e.g. PR distribution) avoids the "convince consumers to pay" challenge.

## Solo founder vs co-founder

- **Pattern David has noticed**: Many founders do their first startup with a co-founder, then go solo on the next one — usually once they have money and can hire people instead.
- **Appeal of solo**: Full autonomy, no need to agree with a peer, can set a higher performance bar, hire a team that reports to you rather than navigating an equal partnership.
- **Risk of solo**: Loneliness, pushing people away, and the "emperor problem" — removing all friction and surrounding yourself with yes-men always ends badly. A co-founder who blocks you and creates friction might be genuinely beneficial *because* of the discomfort.
- **David's current lean**: Interested in trying solo after a potential PetRadar exit, but genuinely unsure. Recognizes both the appeal and the danger.

## Anti-patterns from PetRadar

- Incidental usage (pet goes missing rarely) → hard to build habit/retention
- Tech isn't the hard part → the moat is business/marketing, not engineering
- Go-to-market is the bottleneck, not building the product
