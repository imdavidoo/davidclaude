# PetRadar Team Dynamics

Working style archetypes and how the team fits together. See individual profiles in `people/` for relationship details.

## Working style archetypes

- **David — "the lion"**: Sprints hard, goes all-in, then needs to recover. High intensity but unsustainable without rest cycles. Strength: can move mountains in short bursts. Risk: burnout and frustration when others don't match the pace.
- **Tom — "the stable engine"**: Does something every day at a measured pace. Doesn't push unless needed. Strength: sustainable long-term output, models a grounded approach that has sometimes genuinely inspired David. Both approaches have value.
- **Alex**: Performs best when given tasks in her skill zone — then she pushes really hard. Struggles and resists when asked to do things outside her comfort/skill range. Strength: high performance in her domain. Limitation: the range of what she can push on is narrower than what the team needs.

## Key realization
Different people work differently and should be utilized to their strengths rather than all forced into the same mode. David's hunger for a team of equally driven people may partly be about wanting appreciation for how he shows up, not necessarily identical work styles.
