# Topics to Discuss with Tom

- **LLM delegation = hiring a team analogy**: When you hire people, you have to accept they won't do things exactly how you would — and that's okay. Same applies to using LLMs. You need to let go of some control and accept "good enough" output rather than trying to micromanage every detail. The tradeoff is worth it for scale/leverage.
