## Career direction (Feb 2026 reflection)
- **Engineering > business** — careers test confirmed strongest interest is in engineering, not business. Feels true.
- **Drawn to hard products** — wants to build something that's technically hard to build, where the product itself is so good that adoption follows more naturally. Contrast with PetRadar where the tech isn't the hard part — the business/go-to-market is.
- **PetRadar = "a lot of work" but not technically hard** — the challenge is getting people to use it, serving them well, building the dashboard/website. Not a deep engineering problem.
- **Finish PetRadar first** — committed to completing what they're building. Feels close-ish but realistically probably ~a year more to have a stable product. Wants to see it through for stability (income, completion).
- **Then: build something hard** — after PetRadar reaches stability, wants to work on a product where the engineering is the moat, not the business hustle.
