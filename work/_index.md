# Work

## PetRadar
- **What**: Startup focused on reuniting missing pets
- **Setup**: Remote team
- **Role**: Co-founder & CEO — but day-to-day is mostly front-end coding and product development
- **Co-founder**: Tom (see `people.md`)
- **Colleague**: Alex
- **Duration**: Several years
- **Background**: Commercial internet marketing; transitioning toward product and web development
- **Current project**: Charachorder chord library (3 weeks, Feb 2026) — not directly PetRadar work but investment in tooling/interface. Created guilt about not contributing to the company. Integration phase next (post-Argentina).

## Career history
- See `work/career.md` — Breeze (dating app, ~1.5yr) → PetRadar (current)

## Work philosophy
- Wants to work from strategy, not fear (see `growth/insights.md` for deeper context)
- Rest time is investment in personal life — give full permission to disconnect from work during off-hours
- Fear-driven pushing creates the tension/anxiety that prevents the clear strategic thinking and quality connections he needs most
