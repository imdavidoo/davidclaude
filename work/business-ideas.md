# Business Ideas

Concrete business ideas David has explored. See `work/startup-insights.md` for the underlying principles and evaluation criteria.

## AI Product/Purchase Advisor
An AI assistant that learns your preferences through conversation and recommends products tailored to you — like a human personal shopper, but AI-powered.
- **How it works**: Chat-based interface that gets to know the user over time. When they want to buy something (e.g. clothes on Zalando), the AI browses and finds the best match at the best price.
- **Business model**: Affiliate revenue on recommended products. Free for users → low barrier to entry, high potential for mass adoption.
- **Strengths**: Real use case (David already uses AI to browse Zalando). High LTV from ongoing affiliate revenue. Feature request flywheel possible — users ask for new shopping categories, AI engineering cranks them out.
- **Weakness / risk**: The product naturally expands. Users want help with holidays, self-improvement, general life advice → you end up building a general AI assistant. Big labs (OpenAI, Anthropic) will always be in a better position to win that race. Niche versions (just products, just reflection) have a limited lifespan before being absorbed.
- **Status**: Interesting but likely a dead end due to the general-AI-assistant trap.

## Press Release Toolkit
SaaS tool that helps companies distribute press releases to the most relevant journalists and publishers.
- **How it works**: Index all news articles, blogs, podcasts, and media publications ever published. Vectorize the content. User inputs their press release → system finds publishers who have covered similar topics in the past. Optional region filtering. AI then personalizes the press release for each specific publisher based on their past coverage style.
- **Business model**: Credits-based SaaS. Free tier shows top 3 matches. Pay for more matches, personalized rewrites per publisher, and (eventually) direct sending with email addresses.
- **Strengths**: B2B with clear value prop — companies already spend money on PR distribution. Latent demand (people already do this manually). Technically feasible with vector search. Relatively small/contained build.
- **Future expansion**: Could add journalist email lookup + direct sending.
- **Status**: Promising — contained scope, B2B revenue, doesn't fall into the general-AI trap.

## Personal OS / AI Life System
Productize the David OS concept — an AI-powered personal operating system that manages someone's entire life context. Always-on, learns over time, organizes info across all life areas, retrieves what's relevant, maintains itself.
- Current version: Claude Code + markdown files + CLAUDE.md instructions
- Product angle: make this accessible to non-technical people
- Key value: AI that actually *knows* you and gets better over time, not a blank slate every conversation
- **Weakness / risk**: Same general-AI-assistant trap. Big labs like OpenAI and Anthropic will build this eventually.
